Furthermore, the following sections will briefly describe the steps conducted.
 

## I. Problem Definition (S.I)
The initial step involved clearly defining the problem within the context of debit card fraud detection. This process focused on identifying the key challenges that financial institutions face in detecting fraudulent debit card transactions, providing a solid foundation for the subsequent development of the AI-based fraud detection system (FDS).

<br>  

## II. Literature Review (S.II) [Link Text](Step II: Literature review)
A comprehensive literature review was conducted to understand the current state of AI-based fraud detection systems, exploring advancements in technology and identifying gaps in existing research. This review provided critical insights that informed the design of the system and helped highlight key challenges in the domain.

<br>  

## III. Design Requirements (S.III)
Building on the literature review, critical theoretical design requirements (DRs) for an AI-based FDS were extracted. These requirements formed the basis for the system’s architecture and ensured that the solution addressed both technological and operational needs.

<br>  

## IV. User and Expert Requirements (S.IV)
To ensure that the system was aligned with practical needs, user and expert requirements (URs) were gathered. Semi-structured interviews with users and experts in the field provided valuable insights into their experiences, challenges, and expectations from a fraud detection system.

<br>  

## V. Design Principles (S.V)
From the user and expert requirements, design principles (DPs) were derived. These principles formed the core guidelines for developing an effective AI-based fraud detection system, ensuring it met both technical and operational demands.

<br>  

## VI. Evaluation of Design Principles (S.VI)
The initial design principles were evaluated through expert and user feedback, ensuring that the principles were both relevant and actionable. This feedback led to refinements, helping to improve the principles’ quality and applicability in real-world settings.

<br>  

## VII. Enterprise Architecture (R.VII)
An enterprise architecture (EA) model was developed to visualize and organize the system components, ensuring a clear mapping of the design principles across the business, application, and technology layers. This model helped align the AI-based FDS with the operational structure of financial institutions.

<br>  

## VIII. User Interface Mock-up and Prototype (R.VIII)
A user interface (UI) prototype was developed to showcase the user-centric aspects of the AI-based FDS. This interactive prototype enabled practical evaluation of the design principles, ensuring that user interaction requirements were adequately addressed.

<br>  

## IX. Evaluation of Prototypes (IX)
The prototypes, including the EA model and UI mock-up, underwent thorough evaluation in collaboration with users and experts. Feedback was gathered to assess how well the design principles were integrated and whether they effectively addressed the identified challenges in fraud detection.

## X. Documentation and Design Knowledge (X)
The final step involved documenting the design knowledge gained throughout the itera
